The recommended way to get rust is to use the rustup tool:
https://rustup.rs/

cd gui

for vulkan backend (or metal backend on OS X):

cargo run

for other backends:

cargo run --feature="backend" --no-default-features

with "backend" replaced by "dx11", "dx12" or "gl".  

Right click to select entity, ctrl + right click to see inferred mental states for other entities, hover and tab to circle through multiple entities in the same square.
